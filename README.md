# The Unnamed Soundpad

This project aims to create a desktop soundpad for RPG and tabletop sessions.

## What is this?

The current [unnamed software] is a simple soundpad. It's main (to be) features are:

* A grid os pads with sounds that you can play with your numpad (or clicking)
* Multiple grids per session
* Save/Load sessions
* A list of theme musics
* Use MIDI instruments to play the pads?

_**Wait, why a grid of sounds and a list of musics?**_

It's common in RPG/tabletop sessions that a theme or ambient song is used while
a game master/dungeon keeper/central authority plays sounds as he/she describes the scene. With a list of musics, you can prepare the mood of the scenes, certain that **only one** music is playing. You can use the pads to play other sounds and place more ambiance on top of that.

In the end, the grid can be used for anything, even your theme music.

## What is the technology being used?

Currently: python with tkinter for graphics and pygame for audio. If you think that this combinations should be killed with fire, I agree with you and hope that you can suggest something better.

## Why a desktop app? Why not a web or mobile app?

I like having desktop applications. Mainly because I still carry my laptop to RPG sessions. But I see the appeal of a web/mobile app. Maybe in the future.

## Can I use this?

Yes, you can. But note that this software is in an early stage and do pretty much nothing (and it's ugly)
